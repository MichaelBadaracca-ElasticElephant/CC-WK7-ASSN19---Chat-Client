Create a chat server and client

People should be able to hit a server endpoint to post chats to a common chatroom

Building the backend
    - create a get endpoint to take in new chats and append them to the chatroom's chat
    - each user should have their own session or ability to login
        - create an authentication endpoint

    - user's chats
            should include their username
            time of chat
            content of the chat

Building front-endpoint
    - create a chat page
        - place to show chats
            - shows username and timestamp
            - ability to delete chats?
        - place to enter chats
            - sends chat and clears when you press enter

    - create a section to show if logged in
    - create a login page
        - fields to enter username, password, and confirm password
